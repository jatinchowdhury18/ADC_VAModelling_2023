# Part 1 (ADC 2020)

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Motivation: Introduce several circuit modelling techniques and compare them.
- Topics covered:
  - white-box vs. black-box circuit modelling
  - (Linear) Nodal Analysis
  - Wave Digital Filters
  - Neural Networks
- Demonstrated using example circuits from the Klon Centaur guitar pedal.

# Why Part 2?

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Provide more "depth"
  - Last time we were only able to cover the basics of each technique.
  - Today we'll go a bit deeper!
- New research:
  - Advancements in existing circuit modelling techniques.
  - New and interesting circuit modelling techniques.
